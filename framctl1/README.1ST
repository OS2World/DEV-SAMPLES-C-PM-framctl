 Welcome to our new series on frame controls!  Although Merlin added
 support for the close button, our initial efforts were on Warp.  Also,
 we felt that it was important to leave our close button in the code to
 illustrate the concept of frame extensions.  If you're familiar with
 VisualAge C++ for OS/2 or its predecessor, C Set++, the manifestation
 of this concept is provided via the Open Class Library class,
 IFrameExtension.

 Enjoy!
